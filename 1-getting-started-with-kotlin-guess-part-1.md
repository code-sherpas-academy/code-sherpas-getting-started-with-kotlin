# Getting Started with Kotlin

### Let's play a game!

### ❓ Guess what each line of code does - Part I

###### Step 1: Recommendation. **If possible, print this document and complete the following exercise by hand. ✍️**

###### Step 1: Update the file, commit your changes and push your code to the Github Classroom repository**

We know we’ve not taught you any Kotlin code yet, but see if you can guess ❓ what each line of code is doing. We’ve completed the first one to get you started:

```kotlin

var name = "Misty" // Declare a variable named 'name' and assign to it a value of "Misty"

val height = 9 // Your turn: What does this line do?

println("Hello") // Your turn: What does this line do?
println("My cat is called $name") // Your turn: What does this line do?
println("My cat is $height inches tall") // Your turn: What does this line do?

val a = 6 // Your turn: What does this line do?
val b = 7 // Your turn: What does this line do?
val c = a + b + 10 // Your turn: What does this line do?
val str = c.toString() // Your turn: What does this line do?

val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3) // Your turn: What does this line do?
var x = 0 // Your turn: What does this line do?
while (x < 3) { // Your turn: What does this line do?
  println("Item $x" is ${numbers[x]}) // Your turn: What does this line do?
  x = x + 1
}

val myCat = Cat(name, height) // Your turn: What does this line do?

val y = height - 3 // Your turn: What does this line do?
if (y < 5) myCat.miaow(4) // Your turn: What does this line do?

while (y < 8) { // Your turn: What does this line do?
  myCat.play() // Your turn: What does this line do?
  y = y + 1 // Your turn: What does this line do?
}
```
